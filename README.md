# Five-laya
> Simple Gomoku game powered by layabox engine.
This repo origins from [another repo of mine](https://github.com/SevenOutman/Five-laya/),
which is also a Gomoku game. This one is a reimplementation with layabox of the original one.

## How to play
Once the board is shown, drag your finger on the screen to place your piece (in pink),
and Lily the AI (in blue) will react.

## Demo
The reimplementation is not yet finished, and here's the demo of the original one.
